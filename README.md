***************THIS IS NOW DEPRECATED******************
This wont work anymore since now you need steam mobile auth to login and i cant be bothered to do that!
And Valve also introduced buy orders in the market so this bot is kind of pointless.

Hey guys, this is a Steam Market Bot written in Python 2.

I made this because well i wanted to understand the Steam market and make a quick buck, now im sharing it.

You have to have Python 2 installed with the dependecies specified in the requirements.txt!

The bot has two primary modes of operation: the recent listing mode and the specific item mode.

Note that the specific item mode only works on OSX and Linux, not on Windows. I dont recommend using this mode since it's the least worked on.

The recent listing mode is just that, it checks the recent listings on the Steam market and whenever and item that you want pops up it sees if its worth buying and buys it if it's the case.
It will sell that item automatically for a profit of atleast 10%.

This was a fun project :) I learned a lot of how the Steam market operates!

If you want to donate some items use this link: https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=18934038&token=YLpD8hHY (thanks btw!)
